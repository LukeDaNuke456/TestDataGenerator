# Test Data Generator
This data generation tool creates randomized datasets for testing and development purposes, specifically useful for populating databases in web projects. It simplifies data insertion and enhances testing workflows in software development and data analysis. 

### Operation
This tool generates vehicle data, including ID, year, make, model, mileage, and price. It automatically matches models with makes and calculates prices based on mileage and age. **Note that this program will run commands to create a python virtual enviorment and install python packages.**


### Prerequisites

* Python 3
* Microsoft Excel (to view data)

### Instructions

* Copy Repo and save to a folder of your choosing.
* Open terminal and run the command 'py run.py'.
* If all goes good, you should have an excel file created with the data.


## Notes

**This project is ongoing and there will be more commits. This is only set up for windows, will add Linux / Mac OS functionality later.**
